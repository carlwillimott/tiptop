# Tiptop
This is a really simple soundboard implementation which loads values from a json file.
The sounds are generated by calling the [responsive voice](http://responsivevoice.org/) API.

## Getting Started
To install the relevant npm packages do the following:
```sh
$ npm install
```

Once all installed and up-to date just do the following:
```sh
$ node index.js
```

You can also install forever via npm if you wish to run this on a server for long periods of time.
