# Tiptop
This is a really simple soundboard implementation which loads values from a json file.
The sounds are generated by calling the [responsive voice](http://responsivevoice.org/) API.

## Getting Started
The application has been created using node.js, which makes use of express for the routing and ejs for templating.

To install the required npm packages you can do the following:
```sh
npm install
```

Once you are ready to launch the server, you can run the following:
```sh
node index.js
```

You can also install forever via npm if you wish to run this on a server for long periods of time.
